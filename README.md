# After-Eight-Step
(working prototype) The After Eight Step is an Arduino and Max powered 8 step sequencer with modern machine learning functionality. 
Using Markov Chains it is able to generate musical accompaniment based on any sequence of notes!

2021:
The Max Patch has now been updated to work independently from the Arduino project! It's now much easier to use directly in Max or Ableton due to the new, semi functional, GUI! :D

This GUI emulates the feel of the After Eight Step hardware, but also adds additional features that were difficult to access before.
